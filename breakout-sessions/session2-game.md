# Session 2: Build a Text-Based Game in Python

In this session, you'll create a simple number guessing game directly in GitHub Codespaces. Follow these detailed steps to build, run, and enhance your game.

---

## 1. Read the Challenge

Your challenge is to create a basic number guessing game that:
- **Prompts the user** to guess a number.
- **Provides feedback** on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Optionally** tracks the number of attempts or asks if the user wants to play again.

---

## 2. Generate the Code

- **Option A:** Use an AI tool (like Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT) to generate the Python code for a number guessing game.


---

## 3. Create the Game File

- In the Codespaces file explorer, right-click and select **New File**.
- Name the file `mygame.py` in /portfolio.
- When asked to install python extension say yes!

---

## 4. Paste or Write Your Code

- Open `mygame.py` in the editor.
- Paste the code generated by the AI or type your own code for the number guessing game.
- Save the file (use **Ctrl+S** or go to **File > Save**).

---

## 5. Run the Game

- Open the terminal in Codespaces (if it's not already open, go to **View > Terminal**).
- Ensure you're in the directory where `mygame.py` is located (use `ls` to list files, `cd portfolio` should do the trick).
- Run your game by typing:
  ```bash
  python mygame.py
- Press **Enter** to execute the code

## 6. Debug and Improve

- **Check for Errors:**  
  If error messages appear, read them carefully to identify the issue.
- **Edit Your Code:**  
  Return to `mygame.py`, fix the errors, and save your changes.
- **Re-run the Game:**  
  Execute the command again to test your corrections:
  ```bash
  python mygame.py
- **Enhance Your Game:**  
Consider adding extra features such as:
- Counting and displaying the number of guesses.
- Offering the option to play again after a successful guess.
- Providing hints based on the user's input.

## 7. Commit Your Work

- **Open Source Control:**  
In Codespaces, click the **Source Control** icon (branch icon) in the sidebar.
- **Write a Commit Message:**  
Enter a message (e.g., "Implemented number guessing game with basic features").
- **Commit the Changes:**  
Click the checkmark or press **Ctrl+Enter** to commit your changes.
